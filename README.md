Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, the program will be able to:
1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
2. Calculate average ratings;
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
4. Recommended movies to a given user based on ratings.
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
